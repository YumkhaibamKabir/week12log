 **Technical Steps**

**Learning how to import Csv data into ArcGIS online as a hosted Feature Layer With the help of Arcgis Pro**
 • Firstly, I went to the website of Northern Cyclone Project and then I searched for Csv Data and saved it to my system.
• Then, I imported the csv data as table into my geodatabase which I saved it earlier in my Arcgis Pro, and I converted the table into points with the help of a tool called XY to Table in Arcgis Pro.
• I played around with symbology.
•  And finally, it was shared into Arcgis Online.


**Combining and Publishing the different datasets such as Forest Fire, Tornado and wind speed into ArcGIS online through ArcGIS Dashboard For USA and Canada**
• Firstly, I acquired datasets for forest fire, wind patterns, and tornado occurrences from reliable sources  government agencies Such NOAA, NRCan etc.
• I also ensure datasets cover both USA and Canada regions to provide comprehensive monitoring. And log in to ArcGIS Online.
• Before Creating Dashboard, I Created a web map and into this web map, I add all the significant layers such as forest fire, cyclone etc., and then saved it into my AcrGIS online account.
• I Navigated to the ArcGIS Online instant app and find ArcGIS dashboard. Click on ""Create New "". And Add the web maps which I created earlier for forest fires, wind patterns, and tornado occurrences to the dashboard.
• Starting adding legend, For cyclones, I added widget like  wind speed graphs, and for 
 forest fire, I add pie chart showing percentage. I also add gauge meter for Storm Past week in the U.S.A. Finally, I add the detail information regarding forest fire, storm and 
Wind Speed.
• And also, arranged widgets and data layers in a logical and visually appealing layout.
• Once satisfied with the dashboard, I published it into my ArcGIS Online account. And, set an appropriate sharing permissions based on the requirements.


**Attempting to combine two different datasets through overlay technique in ArcGIS Online resulted in failure.**
• I log in into my ArcGIS online and add all the layers which I need for combining the datasets and went to analysis tool for overlay technique for which it did shows an estimate credit for 15000, then I left it there due to limited available credit.
• Then I started researching again to how to do overlay technique in ArcGIS online, in this process I found a very interesting thing which is cleaning the data which you don’t need it for the analysis in order to save credits. For example, when I was adding layer for cyclone for Canada and tornado for USA, there were lot of count feature in both the layers, during this process I came to understand that the more in count feature will cost me in the more credit which is directly proportional to each other. So, I search for a field which has less count feature because of the available credit I have, so the task is to execute the problem with the available resources."



**Attempting to combine two different datasets through overlay technique in ArcGIS Online resulted in failure.**
• I Imported two datasets into ArcGIS Online: ""live storm data for the past 24 hours, USA"" contains information about COUNTY, LOCATION, etc and 'live storm data past week USA "" containing information about COUNTY, LOCATION, etc.
• I Ensured that both datasets were in compatible formats which is in point form.
• I Utilized the overlay technique to combine the two datasets.
• Selected the ""Overlay"" tool from the Analysis toolbox in ArcGIS Online.
• I configured the overlay tool to perform a spatial join, selecting ""live storm data for the past 24 hours, USA"" as the input layer and ""live storm data for the past week, USA"" as the overlay layer.
• I chose join settings as an attribute relationship and then I used the COUNTY field as target field and COUNTY field as join field.
• I kept join one to one for join operation. And join type as inner join. Finally giving a name for the output file and then check for the credit to run this analysis.
• It is very important to check the estimate credit before you run any analysis tool in Arcgis online since it consumed credit given the credit available is limited.
• In this case it cost me 0.13 credit for this analysis, since it has only 13 count from two layer together. 
• It executed the overlay operation and waited for the process to complete.


 
**Successfully merged two datasets  for USA and Canada Active Forest Fire in ArcGIS Online, resulting in a combined layer with accurate attributes.**
•I Imported ""Forest Fire USA"" containing information on land parcels and ""Active fire Canada""   into ArcGIS Online.
•I Ensured that both layers were in compatible formats and shared similar attributes for merging.
•I Utilized the Merge Layers tool, located within the Analysis toolbox in ArcGIS Online.
•And configured the Merge Layers tool by selecting "" Forest Fire USA "" and "" Active fire Canada "" as the input layers to be merged.
•I specified the desired output layer name, ""Forest Fire Merge USA and Canada”.
•I executed the merge operation.
•The merge operation completed successfully without encountering any errors or warnings. The resulting ""Merged Layer"" contained Stage of Fire from Canada layer and causes of forest Fire from USA layer with attributes appropriately combined.
•The whole process of merging cost me a 0.233 credit.



**Combining Different Datasets  and Publishing the different datasets such as Forest Fire, Tornado and wind speed into ArcGIS online through ArcGIS Dashboard For USA and Canada**
 •I also ensure datasets cover both USA and Canada regions to provide comprehensive monitoring. And log in to ArcGIS Online. 
•	Firstly, I add all the layers of data such Forest Fire USA, Forest Fire Canada, Wind Speed, Canada, Tornado USA, all of them are live data on the top this layers I also add my merging layer.
•	I Navigated to the ArcGIS Online and find ArcGIS dashboard. Click on ""Create New "". And add the web maps which I created earlier for forest fires, wind patterns, and tornado occurrences to the dashboard, merging layer.
•	I added widget like pie chart for the merging layer which is Causes of forest fire in USA and Stages of Forest Fire in Canada.
•	Add a graph of Cyclone in the past weeks County-wise USA. And Live weather update of Canada through embedded Content. Lastly, add details of forest fire Canada and USA information, also the gauge meter for the storm in the past week for USA.  
•	And I arranged widgets and data layers in a logical and visually appealing layout.
•	Once satisfied with the dashboard, I published it into my ArcGIS Online account. And, set an appropriate sharing permission based on the requirements.


**Creation of an ArcGIS Story Map**
• I accessed the ArcGIS StoryMaps platform and logged in and selected a template for my new Story Map project.
• I added maps, images, videos, and text blocks to create a cohesive narrative flow.
• I customized the layout, theme, and design elements to match the desired aesthetic.
• I Integrated the previously prepared data, maps, into the Story Map. And arranged the content sequentially to guide the reader through the narrative and ensure a logical progression.
• Incorporated interactive elements such as sidecar panels, to enhance user engagement.
